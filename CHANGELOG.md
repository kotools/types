## üöß Unreleased

### ‚ú® Added

- The `PositiveInteger` **experimental** type, in the `org.kotools.types`
  package of the `types` module, for representing an integer that is greater
  than zero ([#661]). Contrarily to the integer types provided by Kotlin
  (`Byte`, `Short`, `Int` and `Long`), this type has no maximum value and can
  hold greater values than `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
- The `of(String)` and the `of(String, EmailAddressRegex)` **experimental**
  functions in the `EmailAddress.Companion` type, for creating an instance of
  `EmailAddress` from the specified `text` ([#865]).
- The `EmailAddressRegex.Companion.of(String)` **experimental** function, for
  creating an instance of `EmailAddressRegex` from the specified `pattern`
  ([#868]).

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- The [declarations lifecycle](documentation/declarations-lifecycle.md)
  documentation ([1f9e8151a]).
- The samples of the `EmailAddress.Companion.orThrow(String)` function are now
  easier to understand ([0e1470a48]).
- The documentation of the `EmailAddress.Companion.orNull(String)` and the
  `EmailAddress.Companion.orThrow(String)` **experimental** functions refer to
  the `EmailAddressRegex.Companion.default()` **experimental** function instead
  of the `EmailAddress.Companion.PATTERN` **deprecated** property ([#838]).

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecated

- The `orNull` and the `orThrow` functions of the `EmailAddress.Companion`
  **experimental** type, for using the `EmailAddress.Companion.of` functions
  instead ([#865]).
- The `orNull(String)` and the `orThrow(String)` functions of the
  `EmailAddressRegex.Companion` **experimental** type, for using the
  `EmailAddressRegex.Companion.of(String)` function instead ([#868]).

### üî• Removed

- The `PATTERN` **deprecated** property, the `orNull(String, String)` and the
  `orThrow(String, String)` **deprecated** functions from the
  `EmailAddress.Companion` **experimental** type ([#838]).
- The `Zero` **experimental** type and all its serializers ([#844]). Use
  directly the `0` value instead.

### üêõ Fixed

- Run configurations in [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) ([#854]).
