## 🚧 Unreleased

### ✨ Added

- `Decimal` **experimental** type to `org.kotools.types.number` package,
  representing mathematical decimal numbers with exact arithmetic. Supports
  creation via `fromLong(Long)`, `parse(String)` and `parseOrNull(String)`,
  arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, unary `-`), comparison, and canonical
  string conversion. Division is intentionally excluded because the set of
  terminating decimals is not closed under division. ([#925] originally
  suggested by [@CLOVIS-AI])
- `Integer.toLong` and `Integer.toLongOrNull` **experimental** functions,
  returning the `Long` representation of an `Integer`, or throwing an
  `ArithmeticException` (`toLong`) or returning `null` (`toLongOrNull`) if it's
  out of range for `Long`. ([#1010])
- `NonZeroInteger` **experimental** type to `org.kotools.types.number` package,
  representing an `Integer` other than zero. Supports creation via
  `fromLong(Long)`, `fromInteger(Integer)`, `parse(String)` and their
  `OrNull` variants, structural equality, arithmetic operators (unary `-`
  and `*`), and conversions back to `Integer` and to its decimal string
  representation. Addition and subtraction are intentionally excluded
  because the set of non-zero integers is not closed under these operations.
  ([#1011])
- `NonNegativeInteger` **experimental** type to `org.kotools.types.number`
  package, representing an `Integer` that is greater than or equal to zero.
  Supports creation via `fromLong(Long)`, `fromInteger(Integer)`,
  `parse(String)` and their `OrNull` variants, structural equality,
  arithmetic operators (`+` and `*`), and conversions back to `Integer` and
  to its decimal string representation. Subtraction is intentionally
  excluded because the set of non-negative integers is not closed under this
  operation. ([#998])

### ♻️ Changed

- Changed internal representation of `Integer` **experimental** type from
  `String` to `java.lang.BigInteger` on Kotlin/JVM, `BigInt` on Kotlin/JS, and a
  custom implementation on Kotlin/Native. This avoids parsing when performing
  arithmetic operations. ([#912], [#914] reviewed by [@daniel-rusu]).
- Changed `Integer.div`, `Integer.divOrNull`, `Integer.rem` and
  `Integer.remOrNull` **experimental** functions to use Euclidean division
  semantics: the remainder is always non-negative (`0 ≤ r < |b|`). ([#952])
- Moved `Integer` **experimental** type to `org.kotools.types.number` package,
  and renamed some of its functions (`from` -> `fromLong`, `fromDecimal` ->
  `parse`, `fromDecimalOrNull` -> `parseOrNull`). ([#960], [#1010])
- Reformatted error messages thrown by **experimental** declarations in
  `org.kotools.types.*` (`Decimal`, `Integer`, `EmailAddressRegex`, and the
  `kotlinx-serialization` serializers) to follow a consistent
  `<description>: <value>` structure. ([#988])
- Optimized `parse` and `toString` in the Kotlin/Native implementation of
  `Integer` **experimental** type to process decimal digits in batches of 9
  (10⁹ per step) instead of one digit at a time, reducing iteration count
  ~9×. ([#989])

### 🔥 Removed

- **Breaking:** `orNull` and `orThrow` functions from `EmailAddress` and
  `EmailAddressRegex` **experimental** classes. Use their `of` function instead.
  ([#871], [#872])
- `com.ionspin.kotlin:bignum` dependency, previously used internally by
  `Integer` on Kotlin/Native. ([#962])

### 🐛 Fixed

- Fixed the `serialName` of the `SerialDescriptor` for the `EmailAddress` and
  `EmailAddressRegex` **experimental** default serializers provided by
  `KotoolsTypesSerializersModule()`. These now use explicit, fully-qualified
  names (`org.kotools.types.EmailAddress` and
  `org.kotools.types.EmailAddressRegex`) instead of the type's simple name.
  ([#966])
- Fixed default serializers provided by `KotoolsTypesSerializersModule()` to
  throw an `IllegalStateException` instead of an `IllegalArgumentException` when
  decoding an invalid value, aligning with the exception types recommended for
  `KSerializer` implementations. ([#990])
