# 📋 Architecture Decision Records

This directory collects the architectural decisions made while building
Kotools Types. Each record describes the context, the decision taken, the
rationale behind it, and its consequences.

## 🔄 Superseding records

ADRs are immutable once accepted: a record describes a decision as it was
made, in its original context. When a later change makes a decision
outdated, it is **not** edited in place. Instead:

1. A new ADR is written documenting the updated decision, referencing the
   old ADR (e.g., "Supersedes ADR-XXX") and the change that motivated it.
2. The old ADR's row in the index above is updated to
   "🔄 Superseded by ADR-YYY". The old ADR file itself is left untouched.

[ADR-003](ADR-003-euclidean-division-platform-impl.md) →
[ADR-008](ADR-008-euclidean-division-platform-impl-v2.md) is the first
example of this convention.

## 🚫 No links to source files

ADRs must not link to source files (e.g. `*.kt`). Source files are mutable
implementation details that get renamed, moved, or restructured over time, while
an ADR is a historical record of a decision at a point in time. A link to a
source file may keep resolving after such a change while silently pointing to
code that no longer matches what the ADR described, creating a false impression
of accuracy.

Cross-references in an ADR must instead target either:

- another ADR, by number and title (e.g. "Supersedes ADR-003"), or
- the published API documentation, when a link to a type's current
  definition is genuinely needed.
